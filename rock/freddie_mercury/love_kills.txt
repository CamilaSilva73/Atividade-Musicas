Love don't give no compensation
Love don't pay no bills
Love don't give no indication
Love just won't stand still

Love kills
Drills you through your heart
Love kills
Scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime
Ruining your heart line
Stays for a lifetime
Won't let you go
'Cause love

Love won't leave you alone

Love don't take no reservation
Love is no square deal
Hey, love don't give no justification
It strikes like cold steel

Love kills
Drills you through your heart

Scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime burning your lifeline
Gives you a hard time
Won't let you go
'Cause love
Love
Love won't leave you alone, yeah

Hey, love can play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart
Hey, love kills
Play with your emotions
Open invitation to your heart (to your heart)
Love kills (love kills)

Love kills (love kills)
Love kills (kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill)
Love can play with your emotions
Open invitation
