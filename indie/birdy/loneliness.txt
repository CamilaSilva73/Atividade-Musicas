It’s getting hard to hide
This tainted lullaby
I’m talking in my sleep
The sky is falling down
It’s getting closer now
It’s getting hard to breathe

Your hold has kept my heart in chains
For so long I’ve waited for it to break

Something in the air’s got me feeling you’re here again
And I was missing the dark but now you’re near again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us
I’ve been losing my mind in these sweet dreams of loneliness
I’ve been losing my mind in these sweet dreams

My mind has been so loud
With no way to break out
With nowhere to be still
It’s time to cut these ties
And watch our shadows fly
Let the dark flood in

Your hold has kept my heart in chains
For so long I’ve waited for it to break

Something in the air’s got me feeling you’re here again
And I was missing the dark but now you’re near again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us
I’ve been losing my mind in these sweet dreams of loneliness

I’m not afraid
To be alone
To feel a space
To know you’re gone
To lose control
If nothing more
To feel the burn

Something in the air’s got me feeling you’re here again
And I was missing the dark but now you’re near again
Watching the clock hand fall asleep on us
I’ve been losing my mind in these sweet dreams of loneliness
I’ve been losing my mind in these sweet dreams
